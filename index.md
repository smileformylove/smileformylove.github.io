Now I work at Ubiquitous Artificial General Intelligence Group of TeleAI for multi-modal signal representation, understanding, and AICodec(end-to-end image and video compression) after two years experience at Sensetime Research and half year at Xiaohongshu MediaLab . Before these I was intern at Huawei Cloud and Alibaba Cloud during postgraduate studies. I received bachelor's and a master's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I major in data compression, video compression and signal processing advised by Prof. Hongkai Xiong and Prof. Wenrui Dai at [MIN lab](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/). You can find my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ua29MrwAAAAJ&hl=de) with DCC, CVPR, ICML, ACMMM, ICIP, VCIP, EACL, and I also serve as reviewer for CVPR, ICCV, ACMMM, AAAI, ARR ACL/EMNLP, WACV and PRCV.

I believe **compression is to represent the world**. My current research focuses on the representation of **Multi-Modal Signals Processing**, including image, video, text and audio to verify **everything is embedding** or **everything is token**. While my major job now is to uncover the relationship between compression and generation within multi-modal signal.
