Now He works at Ubiquitous Artificial General Intelligence Group of TeleAI for multi-modal signal representation, understanding, generation, and AICodec(end-to-end image and video compression) after two years experience at Sensetime Research and half year at Xiaohongshu MediaLab . Before these he was intern at Huawei Cloud and Alibaba Cloud during postgraduate studies. He received bachelor's and a master's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He majors in data compression, video compression and signal processing advised by Prof. Hongkai Xiong and Prof. Wenrui Dai at [MIN lab](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/). You can find more publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ua29MrwAAAAJ&hl=de) with DCC, CVPR, ICML, ACMMM, AAAI, SIGIR, ICIP, VCIP, EACL, and he also serves as reviewer for CVPR, ICCV, ICLR, ACMMM, AAAI, ARR ACL/EMNLP, WACV and PRCV.

He believes **compression is to represent the world**. His current research focuses on the representation of **Multi-Modal Signals Processing**, including image, video, text and audio to verify **everything is embedding** or **everything is token**. While his major job now is to uncover the relationship between compression and generation within multi-modal signal.
